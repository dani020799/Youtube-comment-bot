# Youtube-comment-bot

The purpose of this comment bot is to send to random youtube users a comment to check my video.So my video will get more views.
Summery: My video didn't got many  views  no matter where I  published my video.
So I want a solution for that so I came up with an Idea to send notification for many users using youtube comment.
For this to work you will need to get your channel  secret code for api.
A free use of this api can send each day only hundred of comments.
Working methods 
In channels.txt there are codes of youtuwbe channels that the bot is choosing videos in the channels in the file.
After he chooses a video he will randomly choose comments and send them a comment to check my video.
The bot will send a random comment from comments.txt. Its imported to have a lot of comments because if  you send a lot of the same comment youtube will block your ability to send comments for a period of time.
After the bot sent a comment to a user than the bot will had the user code in users.txt.
The purpose of that is not to bother the  same user twice.
My users.txt has 23000 different users code.
The bot does similar  method for videos.
This bot goe my video 13000 views.
